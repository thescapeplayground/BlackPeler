Xiaomeme Community Team Notice:

``` After multiple reports, we are removing the TobrutExotic kernel from this channel. ROMs that include it will not be allowed to be posted.

We have seen that it uses ChatGPT generated code that alters power and thermal behavior. Users have seen fast charging at about 47Â°C. This is unsafe and will damage hardware. If you installed it, we recommend changing it immediately.

The source is public for anyone to review. For future channel releases, kernel sources must be public and provided on request. ```
